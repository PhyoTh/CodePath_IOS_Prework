## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps:

- **Instagram**
  - Smooth transitions and interactive UI
  - Minimalist aesthetic
- **Spotify**
  - Seamless playlist switching
  - Custom recommendations
- **Notion**
  - Flexible block editing system
  - Clean and distraction-free workspace

### App Idea:

I'd like to build a minimalist **habit tracker app** that encourages users to build daily habits through simple check-ins, animated feedback, and motivational quotes. The app would use local notifications to remind users and visually represent progress with calming visuals.

## Notes

- I initially had a crash due to a broken button connection (`unrecognized selector sent to instance`) because the method signature changed but was still linked in Interface Builder. After removing the old connection in the Connections Inspector, everything worked perfectly.
- I also had trouble reopening the Assistant Editor initially, which was solved by restarting Xcode.
